# Platformer Level 

## Repository 

github.com/josephqm/Final-Project/blob/main/Proposal.md 

### Description

The main goal of this prject for me is to create an interactive game experiance with the knowledge gained from the course.  The game will be a 2d platformer akin to the orginal *Mario* titles with the objective of challenging the user to complete the granted level.

#### Features 

Interactible character - pygame library for movement, collision, and to display sprite. math library to possibly calculate player speed

Digital environment (level) - displayed with pygame, collision and interactivity also made with pygame

Hostile enemies - pygame to implement enemy ai for automated movement (also to add collisions that would result in the player's "death") 

Timer - using pygame's clock feature to set a time limit on the player, to force quick decision making

Scoring system (endgoal) - done by a calculation of time expended, enemies defeated, and collectables obtained 

advanced movement (endgoal) - knowledge in python's physics in order to create a more involved gameplay expericene compared to mere WASD movement
