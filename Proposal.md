# Platformer Level 

## Repository 

github.com/josephqm/Final-Project/blob/main/Proposal.md 

## Description

The main goal of this prject for me is to create an interactive game experiance with the knowledge gained from the course.  The game will be a 2d platformer akin to the orginal *Mario* titles with the objective of challenging the user to complete the granted level.

## Features 

Interactible character - pygame library for movement, collision, and to display sprite. math library to possibly calculate player speed

Digital environment (level) - displayed with pygame, collision and interactivity also made with pygame

Hostile enemies - pygame to implement enemy ai for automated movement (also to add collisions that would result in the player's "death") 

Timer - using pygame's clock feature to set a time limit on the player, to force quick decision making

Scoring system (endgoal) - done by a calculation of time expended, enemies defeated, and collectables obtained 

advanced movement (endgoal) - knowledge in python's physics in order to create a more involved gameplay expericene compared to mere WASD movement 

## Challenges 

keeping up to schedule

mastering the pygame library 

getting the right calculations for player movement and score calculation 

## Outcomes

The ideal outcome would be a program that is engageing and that could be expanded upon in the future without a timeframe. The minimal outcome is merely a functional game level that is bug free and can be considered a complete program, despite its simplicity.

## Milestones

### Week 1
assets created or found from an open source, intial game playground initiated 

### Week 2
Creature ai implemented, begin on level design 

### Week 3 
Level design completed, end goal features researched and implemented
