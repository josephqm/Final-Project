## Note: Some information and free assests used from the youtube channel freeCodeCamp.org's "Python Platformer Game tutorial for Beginners" (URL for the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg&list=LL&index=21)

## description 
The main goal of the project is to prove that through the material learnt throughout this course, I am able to create a interactive game through python. To start with the files in the repository, requiremnts.txt is to entail the external library used in the program, pygame. the assests folder holds the platform, background, and character art along with the animation sheet used to animate the player chracter. I definatly feel as there is a lot of room for improvement for a more thought out rendition of the platformer. I think possibly having moving platforms as well as usable items could make a more fleshed out experiance that could result in some replayability to the program it lacks.
